#### **Requirements**
Before running the code, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. **Python Installation**:
   - Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system. You can verify this by running:
     ```bash
     python3 --version
     ```
   - If Python is not installed, refer to [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for installation instructions.

2. **CSV Input Files**:
   - Place the following input files in the same directory as the script, or provide their paths when running the script:
     - `plans.csv`
     - `zips.csv`
     - `slcsp.csv`
   - Ensure these files are properly formatted CSVs with headers matching the field names used in the code.

3. **Permissions**:
   - Ensure you have read/write permissions for the directory where the script and files are located.

#### **Setup Instructions**

1. **Download the Script**:
   Save the Python script to a file named `slcsp_calculator.py`.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - This script relies only on Python's standard library. No additional dependencies need to be installed.

3. **Make the Script Executable** (Optional):
   - Add execution permissions to the script:
     ```bash
     chmod +x slcsp_calculator.py
     ```

---

#### **Running the Script**

1. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the script and input files:
     ```bash
     cd /path/to/directory
     ```

2. **Run the Script with Command-Line Arguments**:
   - Execute the script and provide paths to the required input files and specify the output file:
     ```bash
     python3 slcsp_calculator.py --plans plans.csv --zips zips.csv --slcsp slcsp.csv --output output_slcsp.csv
     ```

3. **Output**:
   - The script will generate an output file at the specified location, containing the calculated SLCSP values.
   - Check the terminal for confirmation messages:
     ```
     Output written to output_slcsp.csv
     ```

#### **File Descriptions**
- **Input Files**:
  - `plans.csv`: Contains insurance plan details. Each row represents a plan with fields such as `metal_level`, `rate`, `state`, and `rate_area`.
  - `zips.csv`: Maps ZIP codes to states and rate areas. Each ZIP code can map to one or more `(state, rate_area)` pairs.
  - `slcsp.csv`: Lists ZIP codes for which the SLCSP needs to be calculated. Contains two columns: `zipcode` and an initially empty `rate` field.

- **Output File**:
  - The output file (e.g., `output_slcsp.csv`) contains the same format as `slcsp.csv`, with the `rate` field populated where the second lowest cost silver plan (SLCSP) could be determined.

---

#### **Error Handling**
- If a ZIP code maps to multiple rate areas or fewer than two silver plan rates exist for a rate area, the corresponding `rate` field will remain blank.
- The script logs warnings for ambiguous ZIP codes or insufficient rates and errors for missing or malformed files.

---

#### **Logging and Observability**
- Progress and warnings are logged to the terminal:
  - Warnings are issued for ambiguous or missing rate areas and insufficient rates.
  - Informational logs indicate the scriptâ€™s progress and output generation.
